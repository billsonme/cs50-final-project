About the website

This is my final project for Harvard CS50x course. It's a simple savings webpage named “BillsOnMe” which is a form of virtual piggybank.

It works by creating an account firstly by choosing a username and password.

Then the user can proceed to add money into the account(Virtual Money). Whatever amount saved is put in the account is divided into a certain category. These categories are Travel, Transportation, Food & Drinks, Shopping, Bills and lastly, Others.

Withdrawal also works by choosing the Category the money comes out of.

Finally, the user is then able to view transaction history.

Created this using CS50 ide with;

HTML
PYTHON
JAVASCRIPT
sqlite3
css

With help from Cs50 web track and some online videos.
